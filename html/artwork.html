                    <h3>SELLOUT</h3>
                        <p>
                            During my first semester of my sophomore year
                            at UMass Dartmouth I had focused a semester long
                            study on the artist Shepard Fairey. At the end of
                            the semester we were allowed to either write a 
                            5 page essay or create a piece inspired by the
                            artist we were studying on. This is my piece 
                            dedicated to Fairey which true to him was appropriating
                            his most successful piece "OBEY" with my own likeness.
                        </p>

                    <h3>F Bodoni</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is a piece that was created during my Typography
                            class at UMass Dartmouth dedicated to the font "Bodoni".
                            Through several itterations of failed compositions I had
                            created this out of pure frustration and it was the most
                            interesting concept I had created. With a few touchups it
                            became a statement poster rather than something that is 
                            simply visually appealing.

                            at UMass Dartmouth. The focus of the project was to create
                            an identity for a product of our choosing with the stipulations
                            that it must be vector artwork and based off of some form of 
                            insect. With rhinosaurus beetle being my insect of choice
                            with the product of carmine (a natural red dye) as the focus
                            I decided to include it in the artwork itself.

                            with as little information as possible. With countless 
                            version of this style being made, this version held itself
                            against the rest by allowing the viewer to have enough
                            information to see the connections amongst them while
                            also seeing the beauty within their own spaces.
