<!-- So this is officially the tenth itteration of this portfolio. Through several attempts and redraws and restarts I'm officially at a place that I can stop and be proud of the portfolio site I have created. This site was created for my Web Typography class at UMass Dartmouth in my sophomore year as the final project. All imagery and code was supplied/created/written by myself [Armani Marquez-Chaves]. The sections that were not my original code was the scrolling image wheel that can be found on the Bio, Artwork, and Recreationals pages. Those were in fact created by Lara Henderson, I however made edits to it to fit my images and the like for my page. My contact page was supplied by W3Schools Online Web Tutorials. It should also be noted that I have done all of my testing and formatting in Google Chrome on a 2010 13in MacBook Pro.

There are two individuals that deserve to be mentioned and they are Lara and Raymond. Lara was my Web Type professor and provided countless ways to voice my issues and assisted and squashing what seemed to be countless bugs within the site I was creating. Raymond was there to help me understand exactly what the issues were and offer some solutions as to what exactly I should do. Raymond assisted me with creating the grid that the site is based on. He helped me realize that I needed to let go of my previous versions of my grid and layout due to the amount of overlapping styles that were causing several bugs at once. Once I had begun a new with teh knowledge from previous attempts this latest version of the code was created swiftly. I plan to constantly update this site beyond this project so that future workplaces may consider my skills within creating and understand html site as well as adapting to the technology based workplaces that society is headed towards.  -->
